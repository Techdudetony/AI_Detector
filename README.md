# AI_Detector
This is a Python Program created to detect whether an image is AI generated. 

# Step 1: Choose a Media Type
**Chosen Media Type:** Images

**Reason:** I chose images because images are often easy to identify due to a consistent pattern of irregular features. Exploring this will provide an understanding of how real photos differ from real ones. 

# Step 2: Collected Examples
Photos 1 – 3: Real photos from my Photo album

Photos 4 – 6: AI Images that were generated on FreePik.com

# Step 3: Brainstorm Specific Traits with AI
**Prompt Used:**
“What traits or characteristics can be used to identify if an image is AI generated?”
**AI Response:**
Identifying whether an image is AI-generated involves analyzing various traits and characteristics that may distinguish synthetic images from those captured or created manually. Below are common markers and techniques to consider:
________________________________________
**1. Unnatural Features**
•	Inconsistent Lighting: Shadows or lighting that do not match the scene's geometry or natural light patterns.

•	Asymmetric or Distorted Features: For portraits, look for mismatched eyes, ears, or facial structures. AI often struggles with perfect symmetry or complex structures.

•	Background Anomalies: Check for warped backgrounds, unnatural blurs, or patterns that repeat unexpectedly.

•	Texture Mismatches: Irregular or overly smooth textures where details should exist, such as skin, fabric, or surfaces.
________________________________________
**2. Artifacts and Errors**
•	Overly Sharp or Blurred Edges: AI-generated images sometimes have inconsistencies in edge sharpness between different parts of the image.

•	Repetition of Patterns: Repeated elements like tiles, fabric designs, or foliage that appear too uniform.

•	Artifacts in Text or Logos: Text in AI images is often illegible or nonsensical. For example, a "STOP" sign might have scrambled letters.
________________________________________
**3. Lack of Real-World Physics**
•	Reflection and Refraction Issues: Reflections in mirrors, glasses, or water may not align with the actual scene.

•	Unrealistic Perspective: Objects might be positioned in ways that defy spatial logic or depth perception.
________________________________________
**4. Resolution and Pixel-Level Indicators**
•	Excessive Smoothness or Over-Rendering: AI images may lack natural noise or grain, appearing overly polished.

•	Artifacts at Pixel Level: On close inspection, pixelation or unusual transitions can be present, especially in older AI models.

•	Overly Consistent Details: Features such as individual hairs or leaves might appear too uniformly placed.
________________________________________
**5. Metadata Analysis**
•	Missing or Inconsistent Metadata: AI-generated images often lack camera-related metadata (e.g., lens type, aperture settings) and may include clues pointing to generation software.

•	Generation Tags: Some images contain tags referencing specific AI tools, like MidJourney, DALL·E, or Stable Diffusion.
________________________________________
**6. Unnatural Context**
•	Unusual or Improbable Scenes: Look for scenes that seem overly surreal or implausible in reality.

•	Hyper realistic or Synthetic Aesthetics: Colors may appear overly vibrant, or objects may have a dream-like quality inconsistent with natural photography.
________________________________________
By examining these traits, you can better determine whether an image is AI-generated. However, as AI technology continues to advance, distinguishing between real and generated content may become increasingly challenging.

**Traits Selected for Analysis:**
1.	 Hyper realistic or Synthetic Aesthetics 
2.	Overly Consistent Details 
3.	Asymmetric or Distorted Features
